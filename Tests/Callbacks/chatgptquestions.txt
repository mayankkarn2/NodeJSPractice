Here's the scenario:

Fetch User Data: Create a function fetch. UserData that takes a user ID and a callback function. Simulate fetching user data from a database (you can use a hardcoded object for simplicity). Invoke the callback function with the user data once it's fetched.

Image Processing: Write a function that processes an image file (e.g., resize, crop) and takes a callback to handle the processed image.

Reading Multiple Files: Create a function that reads multiple files concurrently using the fs module. Use a callback to handle the content of each file.

Sequential File Reading: Implement a function that reads multiple files sequentially (one after another) using callbacks.

Database Migration: Simulate a database migration script. Write a function that performs database migration steps and takes a callback to handle the success or failure of each step.

Real-Time Data Processing: Implement a function that processes real-time data from a stream (e.g., logs). Use a callback to handle each data point.

WebSocket Connection: Create a WebSocket server using the ws library. Use callbacks to handle WebSocket events such as connection, message, and close.

Asynchronous File Upload: Develop an endpoint in an Express.js application that handles asynchronous file uploads. Use a callback to handle the result of the file upload.

Generating Reports:Write a function that generates a report (e.g., PDF, CSV) and takes a callback to handle the generated report.

Batch Processing: Implement a batch processing script that processes a large dataset in smaller batches. Use a callback to handle the results of each batch.

REST API Callbacks: Create an Express.js application with multiple RESTful endpoints. Use callbacks to handle requests and send appropriate responses.
